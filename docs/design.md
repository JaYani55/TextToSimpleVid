# v1.0 Text-to-Video System Documentation and Project Plan

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a modular, extensible “text-to-video” system that accepts Markdown files as input and produces a video output with the following features:

1. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion:**  
   - Convert Markdown text into speech using the ElevenLabs API.  
   - The TTS module must be modular so that it can be easily swapped out for another API or a local TTS system later on.

2. **Audio Visualizer:**  
   - Use the generated speech audio as a basis for an audio visualizer that serves as the baseline visual layer.
   - The visualizer should be configurable with parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude, bar size).

3. **Media Insertions:**  
   - **Images:** When special formatting is detected (e.g., `[[imagepath: <path>, duration: X, effect: edge|rotoscope]]`), display the image in the video.  
   - **Video Files:** Similarly, when a video file is specified (e.g., `[[videopath: <path>, transition: fade, effect: rotoscope]]`), include the video clip with smooth transitions.
   - Effects like edge extraction and rotoscoping must be configurable per asset via parameters defined within the Markdown formatting.

4. **Background Audio Layer:**  
   - An additional audio layer for background sounds or a specific sound file may be specified in the Markdown. This sound will be mixed with the TTS audio and visualizer output.

5. **Subtitles:**  
   - Display the original text as subtitles synced with the audio throughout the video.

6. **Project Modularity and Configuration:**  
   - The project must be compartmentalized into well-defined modules (TTS, visual effects, media parsing/insertion, subtitle rendering, audio mixing).
   - All effects and parameters should be clearly demarcated and configurable via external configuration files or in-text parameters.
   - The overall system should be easy to extend (e.g., adding new effects, supporting new file formats) and maintain.

```

### Module Descriptions

- **Markdown Parser:**  
  - Reads a Markdown file and extracts plain text, special markers (e.g., `[[imagepath: ...]]`, `[[videopath: ...]]`, `[[audio: ...]]`), and timing/effect parameters.
  - Produces a structured representation (e.g., a JSON object) to be used by the orchestrator.

- **TTS Module:**  
  - Provides an interface for text-to-speech conversion using the ElevenLabs API.
  - Accepts text input and returns an audio stream or file.
  - Must be designed in a way that swapping to another TTS provider is straightforward (i.e., through an abstract interface).

- **Audio Visualizer:**  
  - Uses the TTS audio to generate dynamic visualizations (e.g., animated bars, waveforms).
  - Output is a series of frames or an overlay video layer.

- **Media Modules (Image & Video):**  
  - Process image assets: apply effects like edge extraction or rotoscoping, resize/scale assets, and determine display duration based on parameters.
  - Process video assets: apply transitions (e.g., fade, blend), optionally process the first frame (rotoscoped) and blend it with the morph transition.

- **Subtitles Renderer:**  
  - Renders the original text as subtitles overlayed onto the video.
  - Must support timing synchronization with the audio.

- **Audio Mixer:**  
  - Mixes different audio layers (TTS, background sound) together.

- **Orchestrator (Main Script):**  
  - Coordinates all modules to process a Markdown file and generate the final video.
  - Handles timing, composition, and renders the final output.

- **Configuration and Logging:**  
  - Global configuration files allow customization without changing code.
  - A logger utility for debugging and tracking the process flow.

## Requirements

1. **Input Requirements:**  
   - Accept Markdown files with embedded media markers.
   - Markers may include parameters in a key-value format (e.g., `[[imagepath: yes_shape.svg, duration: 5, effect: edge]]`).

2. **Output Requirements:**  
   - A final video file (e.g., MP4) that shows:
     - The audio visualizer as the baseline.
     - Media insertions (images/videos) at defined times with specified effects.
     - Text subtitles that display the original content.
     - Mixed audio (TTS speech and background sound if provided).

3. **Performance Requirements:**  
   - Reasonable processing time for typical inputs (under a few minutes for a 3–5 minute video on a modern machine).
   - Maintain synchronization between audio, visuals, and subtitles.

4. **Modularity & Extensibility:**  
   - The TTS module must be abstracted.
   - Effects (for image/video processing) should be configurable via external config.
   - New media types or effects can be added with minimal changes to the orchestrator.

5. **Error Handling & Logging:**  
   - Detailed logging of processing steps.
   - Graceful failure for missing assets or incorrect parameters.

6. **Environment & Deployment:**  
   - Use Python 3.x.
   - Dependencies managed via `requirements.txt`.
   - Optionally, containerize the application for easier deployment.
   - Provide a command-line interface (CLI) for processing a given Markdown file.

## Design Considerations & Reasoning

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  Breaking the project into discrete modules allows independent development, easier testing, and the ability to swap components (e.g., TTS provider) without affecting other parts.

- **Configuration-Driven Behavior:**  
  Using YAML/JSON configuration files (stored in `config/`) ensures that default parameters and effects can be easily adjusted. This also makes the system more accessible to non-developers who need to tweak settings.

- **Abstract Interfaces:**  
  Defining clear interfaces (for example, a TTS interface with a method `synthesize(text: str)`) helps in replacing components later (e.g., switching from ElevenLabs to another TTS service).

- **Subtitles Synchronization:**  
  A robust subtitle module should be integrated early on, with clear timing derived from either the Markdown (if time codes are provided) or the TTS duration (estimated based on text length and speech rate).

- **Asset Processing:**  
  Image and video processing routines should be designed to allow chaining of effects. For instance, an image may first be processed for edge extraction and then scaled/rotoscoped based on the effect parameters.

- **Visual Composition:**  
  The orchestrator must handle layering: background (audio visualizer), media assets, subtitles, and transitions. A frame-based or time-based composition approach (using libraries like OpenCV or FFmpeg) may be suitable.

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Input Formatting:**  
   - What exact syntax should be used in the Markdown file for media markers? For example:  
     - `[[imagepath: path/to/image.svg, duration: 5, effect: edge]]`
     - Should we support multiple parameters separated by commas?
2. **Subtitles:**  
   - Should subtitles be auto-synced with the TTS audio timing, or can time codes be provided in the Markdown?
3. **Visual Effects:**  
   - Are there any predefined effects (beyond edge extraction and rotoscoping) that should be supported in v1.0?
4. **Audio Mixing:**  
   - Is there a specific format for specifying background sound (e.g., a file path and volume parameter)?
5. **Deployment Environment:**  
   - Do you expect this system to be run as a standalone CLI tool, or should it be packaged as a web service?
6. **Error Handling:**  
   - What is the preferred approach for error notifications (console logs, error video frames, etc.)?
